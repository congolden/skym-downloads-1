### Soft Synth Instructions

Wether you are working in Ableton, Bitwig, or any other DAW. The synth control CC's can be midi learned to macros or parameters. This method has been tested with Massive and Serum, but should apply to any other soft synth. 

Right click on the macro or parameter you wish to map
Click on MIDI Learn
On the Skym app, in settings, tap the label of the synth CC you wish to map, this will send a singular message to learn to the parameter

Some synths allow you to save the midi mapping, so it is avalible in every instance of the synth.

To use the provided presets for Massive and Serum, map Synth X, Y, and Z to Macros 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

## Uses

The Skym app has 2 main modes: synth mode [sine.png] and control mode [automation.png]. 

Synth mode passes a Midi note along with 3 control CCs all on the same channel. This data is not intercepted byt the software as remote control data. Rather, it is only recieved by a synth if the synth's track is armed. This lets you use multiple synths, multiple tracks, and multiple presets without having to map or remap the CCs. Generally, synth vsts have a midi mapping that can be saved and used for all instances of the plugin.

Control Mode has a similar output to synth mode, but without the note on. On predefined outputs (Ableton or Bitwig), the channel and cc's sent by Skym are hard set and are intercepted by the script (included in the software folder in this package). X, Y, and Z ccs are mapped to device macros 1, 2, and 3. No Midi mapping or learning has to be done if you are using a script (Ableton or Bitwig). The scope of Control mode will update based on what device you have selected. AS you change devices, the display of Skym will update to match parameters 1, 2, and 3. Recorded automation of these macros will play back and animate on Skymation.
